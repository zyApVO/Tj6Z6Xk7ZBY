### Notes from Practices of an Agile Developer
*  Tackle small problems while they are still small  
*  Explore the unknown before you invest too much in it  
*  In an Agile team the primary focus should be Outcomes. Leave ego's at the
    door  
*  Outcome is what's important, not the credit, blame, or anything else  
*  If you arn't making any mistakes youre probably not trying hard enough  
*  There may not be a best answer, just a more suitable solution  
*  Don't start rejecting and rewriting simply because you can't understand it
    right away.  That's not courage; that's impatience.  
*  A well educated team is a better team.  Figure out how to level up and
    elevate the people around you.  
*  It's important to have iteration schedules so you get in a state of flow with
    pushing features.
*  When doing upfront design work: discuss possible class designs in terms of
    responsibilities.  What are classes supposed to do?  What other objects will
    work with it to get the job done?  
*  A good design is accurate, but not precise.
