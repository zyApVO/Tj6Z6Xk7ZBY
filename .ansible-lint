  # This can be removed when situation with publishing DebOps Collection on

  # This check warns that a 'run_once' keyword will not work correctly on task
  # level in playbooks with "free" strategy, but ansible-lint doesn't take the
  # strategy of a given play into account, so the check is moot. A solution is
  # to ignore the check on the task level.

  # This tag is not correctly detected on the task level using "noqa" comment,
