# Resources for teaching with and about GIS using online data, tools, and other information
## [Joseph Kerski](https://www.josephkerski.com/)

Teaching with GIS and about GIS in a fully online environment can be successfully accomplished with Esri
GIS software, data, and core content. 

Given the current challenge of moving your GIS courses to a fully
online environment, faculty can (1) use the resources and lessons below, choosing those that will mesh
into your existing course goals, or (2) run your existing courses in a virtualized environment.

## Learning Plans
One of the easiest ways to implement online GIS tools, data, and activities is with a Learning Plan. These
are ready-to-go sets of courses that you can implement right away.

ArcGIS Pro. See notes on ArcGIS Pro below.
### 2.01. ArcGIS Online: https://www.arcgis.com ArcGIS Online contains 40 analytical tools, including
routing, overlay, proximity, standard deviational ellipse, other tools, along with the ability to access data
from the community of ArcGIS Online users, from ArcGIS Pro, from open data portals, and from the
Living Atlas of the World.

can be instantly mapped and analyzed.
### 2.05. Dashboards
[Dashboards](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/) allow you to understand an issue by creating a short but informationpacked display of graphs, maps, and gauges.
### 2.06. Storymaps
[Storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) allow you and your students to teach about relevant local-to-global issues,
and to communicate about current event, issue, or problem to classmates and colleagues using
multimedia and interactive maps.
