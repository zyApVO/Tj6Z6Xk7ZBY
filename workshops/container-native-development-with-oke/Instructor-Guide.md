# Workshop Instructor Guide

## How to request GSE workshop environments

- Navigate to [http://demo.oracle.com](demo.oracle.com) and sign in.

- Click **Demos** in the top navigation menu

- Click the **Workshop Requests** button above the 'My Demo Registrations' table

- Click the **Request Workshop** button

- In the **Search Workshop Titles** bar, type **VM** and click **Go**.

- In the search results, locate the entry called **UCM Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VM Services**. In the calendar displayed in that row, locate the date that you want to conduct the workshop. Click the **number of seats** in the colored box under the date you want. If the number is smaller than your required number of workshop participants, you will need to choose a different date with more environment availability.

- On the 'New Workshop Request' page, fill out the customer and contact information for the workshop. Under **DataSet Recipe**, select **UCM Clean Environment**. For **Number of Participants**, enter the number of individual accounts you require for your workshop. This would ideally be one per participant, but if capacity is limited participants can work in teams to complete the workshop.

- Once you have filled out the required fields, click **Submit** at the top right of the page to complete your request. You will receive an acknowledgement email from GSE, followed by a confirmation email once your request has been reviewed and approved. Until you receive the approval email, your request is not guaranteed to be filled by GSE, and you should not yet confirm availability with the participants.

- Once your workshop request is approved, you will be able to return to demo.oracle.com to input the participants' email addresses into the request. Use the **Participants Management** link in the 'My Workshop Requests' table (Demo tab -> Workshop Requests) to input the addresses. Each participant will get an email the day before the workshop allowing them to log in to demo.oracle.com and obtain the credentials for their account. If you choose not to supply email addresses in the request, you will have to distribute credentials manually to each participant.

- On the day of the workshop, once the environments are provisioned, you can view the details and credentials for each account by clicking the **Access Details** link in the 'My Workshop Requests' table.
